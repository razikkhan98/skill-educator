                      History and Evolution JavaScript was created by Brendan
                      Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications.
                      Initially, it was intended to enhance the browser's
                      interaction capabilities by allowing client-side
                      manipulation of web pages. Early on, it was known as
                      "LiveScript" but was renamed to JavaScript to capitalize
                      on the growing popularity of Java at the time, although
                      the two languages are not related. Over time, JavaScript
                      became the de facto language of the web, standardized
                      under the ECMAScript (ES) specification. Each version of
                      ECMAScript introduced improvements: ES5 (2009): Added
                      features like strict mode, JSON support, array methods
                      (e.g., forEach, map), and more. ES6/ES2015 (2015):
                      Introduced major changes such as let and const for
                      block-scoped variables, arrow functions, template
                      literals, classes, promises, and modules. ES7-ES13
                      (2016-2022): Continued to add async functions, optional
                      chaining, nullish coalescing, and many other powerful
                      language features.
