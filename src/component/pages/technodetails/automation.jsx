                        <strong>HISTORY AND EVOLUTION:</strong>
                      </div>
                      History and Evolution JavaScript was created by Brendan
                      Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications.
                      Initially, it was intended to enhance the browser's
                      interaction capabilities by allowing client-side
                      manipulation of web pages. Early on, it was known as
                      "LiveScript" but was renamed to JavaScript to capitalize
                      on the growing popularity of Java at the time, although
                      the two languages are not related. Over time, JavaScript
                      became the de facto language of the web, standardized
                      under the ECMAScript (ES) specification. Each version of
                      ECMAScript introduced improvements: ES5 (2009): Added
                      features like strict mode, JSON support, array methods
                      (e.g., forEach, map), and more. ES6/ES2015 (2015):
                      Introduced major changes such as let and const for
                      block-scoped variables, arrow functions, template
                      literals, classes, promises, and modules. ES7-ES13
                      (2016-2022): Continued to add async functions, optional
                      chaining, nullish coalescing, and many other powerful
                      language features.

                      Automation Testing is a software testing technique that
                      uses automated tools and scripts to execute test cases,
                      replacing manual human efforts. It is employed to validate
                      the functionality, performance, and reliability of
                      software applications across different scenarios without
                      manual intervention. This approach is particularly useful
                      for repetitive, large-scale, and time-consuming tasks,
                      ensuring that software behaves as expected while saving
                      time and resources. Automation testing is a software
                      testing technique where test cases are executed with the
                      help of automation tools, rather than being manually run
                      by a human tester. It involves writing scripts to automate
                      the testing process, helping to ensure that applications
                      perform as expected without requiring constant manual
                      effort.
